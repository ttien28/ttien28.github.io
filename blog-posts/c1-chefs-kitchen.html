<h3> Cultural Blog: Chefs Kitchen<h3>
<p>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>

<p>The DBC experience has proven to be a challenge of personal growth and commitment that yields immense benefits if done the right way. Shareef says, &quot;If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. DBC will help you go fast and far.&quot; I think it requires people to shift their minds from &quot;I can&#8217;t do this&quot; to &quot; I can&quot; and finally to &quot;I am a web developer.&quot; I see myself being very engaged in this type of culture and getting my hands dirty in the &quot;kitchen.&quot; Throughout my academic career, I&#8217;ve been so used to only being minimally engaged, such as through lecture and simply taking notes and &quot;studying.&quot; The idea behind DBC is that you can thrive the most when you&#8217;re actually behind the kitchen counter with other student cooks, who all are looking forward to one day becoming professional chefs. This makes me excited because DBC really wants to provide an environment that is engaging and inspires a sense of eagerness for learning that truly stems from the student&#8217;s genuine desire to learn and be challenged and pushed. All students are expected to take ownership of their experience at DBC. According to Sheriff, we need to remind ourselves to shift from the &quot;restaurant&quot; mindset to the &quot;kitchen mindset.&quot; DBC should not be an all-inclusive package with a price tag with an entitlement to an experience. It is what you make of it. The only nervousness I feel is regarding one of the &quot;fears&quot; that Sheriff addressed in his Fireside: 1) The fear of the &quot;imposter syndrome&quot; (How did I get accepted? Am I even smart enough compared to others in my cohort?) or 2) The mediocre experience and feeling bored and unchallenged.
I definitely have the first fear but I understand that I need to work past it. I know that getting past this fear will result in many achievements in my journey at DBC. </p>
