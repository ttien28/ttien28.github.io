  <a href="3"><h3>Week 2: 5-Responsive Design Reflection</h3></a>
<p>Discuss the following:</p>
<p>** What did you learn about design and user experience?**
<p>Design is an immensely difficult task as you consider user experience. People are more attracted to intuitive and simple sites rather than sites that require too much "work".</p>

<p>** Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)**</p>

<p>Although it was a tedious process, I did enjoy it. Making real-time changes to my site was more fun than the actual wireframing. I find that I like to dive in and get my hands dirty rather than doing the actual planning and designing. I like to test things out and experiment with different concepts.</p>

<p>** What was your process? What worked and didn't work?**</p>

<p>I experimented with different icons on the Font Awesome website. I was surprised to see so many sites that have icons pre-designed and that all you have to do is insert HTML and CSS tags into your code and it would work. While I got some arrow icons onto my page, it was a challenge to experiment with margins and padding to make it look aligned and aesthetically consistent with the rest of the other pages.</p>

<p>** What would you like to add or change about the site next?**</p>

<p>I would add more interactive aspects for my site. I think that will come naturally as I learn Javascript in the weeks to come. I would look more into my color scheme and make my site look more cohesive. I would change the font styles to include bold and italicized words for effective and attractive text. </p>


<p>** Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?**</p>

<p>It was not difficult applying the material. I find that I am a learn-by-doing person. So when I don't understand a certain concept, I just got ahead and code it to see what happens. This is what I did to understand margins and padding. I thought that Font Awesome was a great tool for beginners.</p>


<p>** What else do you want to build, make a list to check back on later!**
 1. animation: makes the next website slide into place
 2. cascading organizational tables for my index that would list blogs for Week 1, Week 2, etc.</p>

<p>** Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**</p>
