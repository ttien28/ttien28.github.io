      <h3>Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>
      <p>Gregorc&#8217;s Mind Styles provides and organized way to consider how the mind works. After taking the test, I found that my thinking style falls under the "<span id="cs">Concrete Sequential</span>" category.</p>

    <p>I find that this analysis of my way is thinking is very on point. I like guided practice and being able to apply new ideas in a practical, hands-on way. I definitely appreciate when infomation is presented to me in a organized manner. I used to find that working with others and in groups a bit intimidating for me but it is getting easier because of weekyl activities such as pair programming and GPS sessions. I work well with people who can communicate clearly their approaches to new obstacles. At DBC, my learning style will translate into being organized in order to manage upcoming deadlines and tasks for current projects.</p>

  <h3>Fixed vs Growth Mindset</h3>
  <p>I found a great article called <a href="www.liveboldandbloom.com/07/habits/growth-mindset>Growth Mindset: 6 Key Ways to Unlock Your Potential">Growth Mindset: 6 Keys to Unlock Your Potential</a>. According to this article by Dr. Carol Dweck, a professor of psychology at Stanford University, here are a few things I can do to broaden the way I think and learn:
    <ol>
      <li><em>Begin with awareness: </em> I will notice how I react to new challenges or failures and "catch" myself in a fixed mindset. </li>
      <li><em>Push through challenges: </em>When I feel like I've hit a wall, it's to take a break and keep going afterward. </li>
      <li><em>Seek constructive criticism: </em>: I take my GPS feedback very seriously and try to apply the suggestions from my guide. </li>
