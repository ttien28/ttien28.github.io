    <h3>JavaScript in Web Development</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages due entirely to its role as a scripting language of the world wide web.</p>
      <p> Today, accessing the web varies heavily  across device, screen size, and browser, which is why it&#8217;s generally unwise to commit to a particular technology. Lately, however, more and more large organizations are trusting their development to Javascript.</p>


      <h3>The Advantages and Disadvantages of JavaScript</h3>
      <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>JavaScript works on all devices and in all browsers, pretty much guaranteeing that your HTML page will always render. </li>
            <li>Most JavaScript programs execute in a web browser, but Node.js executes on the server-side. This has the distinct advantage of allowing one developer, or a single small team, to work on both front-end, back-end at the same time. </li>
            <li>Javascript is relatively fast to the end user.
              As the code is executed on the user&#8217;s computer, results and processing is completed almost instantly depending on the task (tasks in javascript on web pages are usually simple so as to prevent being a memory hog) as it does not need to be processed in the site&#8217;s web server and sent back to the user consuming local as well as server bandwidth. </li>
            <li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Security issues</li>
              <li>JavaScript rendering varies resulting in inconsistency in terms of functionality and interface.</li>
            </ol>
