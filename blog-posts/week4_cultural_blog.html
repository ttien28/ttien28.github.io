  <h2 >Cultural Blog: Customer Data Protection</h2>
  <h4>From article: <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/google-goes-public-with-security-audits-to-assuage-enterprise-concerns/">"Google Goes Public with Security Audits to Ease Corporate Concerns"</a></h4>
    <p id="date">August 27<sup>th</sup>, 2014</p>

    <p>For as long as there as been the internet, there has been concerns over the security and protection of personal data. Most notably to shed light on this issue has been Google, who for the first time, is making two independent security audits available for public viewing. Google is taking unprecedented steps to show to educate its customers that data protection is its top priority.</p>

    <p>I believe that all internet businesses should be transparent with the way that customer data is being stored. Just like what Google did, they should release their security audits to the public. The challenge in data privacy is to share data while protecting personally identifiable information. The fields of data security and information security design and utilize software, hardware and human resources to address this issue. As the laws and regulations related to Data Protection are constantly changing,it is important to be aware of any changes in the law and continually reassess your compliance with data privacy and security regulations.
