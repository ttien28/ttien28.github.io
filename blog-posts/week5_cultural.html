    <h3>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h3>
    <p>I have to admit. Pairing is hard. Sometimes it&#39;s a combination of a whole lot of feelings such as: frustration, fear, intimidation, happiness and confusion. But it&#39; also an extremely beneficial and amazing learning experience. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with other students and seeing their different learning and thinking styles, some that complemented my own and some that I required me to adjust my thinking process. The most challenging part is definitely the communication between two partners above all else. Regardless of where my partner and I was in our level of programming knowledge for the week, our session flowed more smoothly when we were able to clearly state when we were confused, lost or needed help. I had a lot of trouble with this at first and felt that I was holding my partner back by asking a lot of questions. It felt like I was exposing my weaknesses and that fact that I was extremely new to the programming world. However, it is immensely rewarding coming out of a pairing session and feeling <em> Wow, I just learned something new.</em>The frustrating parts of pairing is when my partner and I are both stuck and stumped on a specific part of a code and we are both trying to Google ways to make things work. It takes a lot of time and patience.</p>

    <p>I take my feedback seriously and do what I can to better myself and definitely appreciate actionable and genuine feedback. For example, I&#39;ve been told that I seem like I refrain from saying certain things. I think it may be because I don&#39;t want to sound ignorant. I&#39;ve since learned to be more open and honest especially when I don&#39;t understand something. I don&#39;t have any issue with leaving feedback for my partner although I try to be as specific as I can to give feedback that is useful. Overall I have received kind and positive feedback.
