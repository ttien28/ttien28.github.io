  <h2 >Cultural Blog: "Stereotype Threat"</h2>
    <p id="date">September 11<sup>th</sup>, 2014</p>
<div id = content>
    <h3>What is stereotype threat?</h3>
    <p>By definition, stereotype threat is a situation in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group.</p>

    <h3>What are its consequences?</h3>
    <p>In education, it can also lead students to choose not to pursue the domain of study and, consequently, limit the range of professions that they can pursue. Therefore, the long-term effects of stereotype threat might contribute to educational and social inequality.</p>

    <h3>My Experiences </h3>
    <p>Whether I want to believe this or not, being raised in Asian culture comes with the set of beliefs that I have to somehow excel at everything I do when it comes to education and career. But don&#8217;t count on me solving me your math problems...I hate math. I was always <em> ehhhh </em> about science. Yes, I do play a musical insturment, but hell, I suck at sports. So yeah, I&#8217;m not your typical Asian kid. I always wondered why I couldn&#8217;t be like my sister, or the other engineers, teachers or doctors that I had in my household. This in turn, led me to believe that I had a fixed growth mindset I that was so sure I couln&#8217;t get out of. But I did. And this process took a lot of self-discovery. </p>
    <p>I know that I&#8217;ll face this &quot;stereotype threat&quot; and imposter syndome at DBC but I have to realize that I can&#8217;t let these things get to me, and that I&#8217;m here for a reason. That is to try my hardest to learn and grow alongside everyone else in my cohort. It will be a difficult journey but worth every step.</p>
