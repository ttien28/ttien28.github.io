  <h3>Exploring My Values</h3>
    <p>I think about the times in my life that I&#8217;ve been the
happiest, the proudest and most satisfied. They&#8217;re moments of pure job and triumph. Words can only go so far to describe the whirlwind of emotions that are elicited in me when these events occur but I can certainly name a few: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accomplishment</li>
    <li>Achievement</li>
    <li>Commitment</li>
    <li>Growth</li>
    <li>Personal Development </li>
    <li>Will-power</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Why is this important to me?</h3>
  <p>Not only are the words I mentioned above a series of feelings, they also stand for values. These are values that I always try my absolute best to adhere to and live by. The value that stands out to me the most is &quot;Will-power&quot;.

    <p>We&#8217;ve all heard of the saying, &quot;Where there&#8217; a will, there&#8217;s a way&quot;. Taking the first step toward any goal requires an interal desire and determination for change in the face of resistence. Without it, that first step (usually the hardest step) will never be taken. For that reason, I believe that will-power is the catalyst for change and the ultimate force the leads to personal growth and achievement.
