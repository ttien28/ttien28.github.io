    <h3>Formulating Good Questions</h3>

    <p>It&#8217;s an amazing feeling knowing that I&#8217;ve gotten through 2 months of prep for DBC. Within this prep period, I&#8217;ve asked numerous questions - whether it was to other students, GPS guides, tutors in office hour, or speaking to someone already working in the web development field. I found that the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">article</a> from Stackoverflow is a great reminder as to how we should go about asking questions, especially in the web development community. Well-asked questions will provide  insightful answers so we should make them engaging, specific and thoughtful.</p>

<h3> Some tips for good questions!</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Try not to ask yes or no questions, whenever possible: When you ask a yes or no question, you will most often get incomplete information. Instead, ask an open-ended question. By using an open-ended question you get insights and additional information you might not have known existed. </li>
  <li>Dig deeper: Always consider using follow-up questions. Unless you are looking strictly for the facts, there is some sort of assumption in the answer the person gives you. Ask them a follow up question such as, &quot;What makes you say that?&quot; or &quot;Why do you think that?&quot; </li>
  <li>Don't let silence make you uncomfortable: Start getting comfortable with asking a question, waiting for response, listening to the response and then waiting some more. Many times the person you are questioning has more information and will bring it out when you wait for it. </li>
<li>Lastly, don&#8217;t interrupt: Don&#8217;t interrupt the person with whom you are talking. First, it tells the person you don&#8217;t value what they are saying. Interrupting stops their train of thought and directs the conversation the way you want, not necessarily the way it should go. Ask your question, then let the person answer it in full, even when you think you are not getting the answer you want. Listen fully to what they are saying and use that to direct them back to the topic in the next question when there is a natural pause. </li>
</ul>
