      <p>Pair programming occurs when two people work together at a single work station to solve a coding problem.</p>
      <h3>Why is it important at DBC?</h3>
      <p>At DBC, pairing teaches you how to be practice empathy and how to build relationships with others. Pairing is important because it allows you to work collaboratively with other students to simulate real-world working environments. In addition, it demonstrate respect and patience toward your pairing partner, too. </p>
      <h3><a id="guidelines">Guidelines and Etiquette</a></h3>


        <ol>
            <li>Check in with each other at the beginning of each session.</li>
            <li>The two partners should designate the following roles: driver and navigator.</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Discuss driver and navigtor responsibilities. Agree to switch after a specific time.</li>
              <li>The driver's role is to do the actual coding on the keyboard</li>
              <li>The navigator guides the discussion.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Be sure to submit feedback after the end of the pairing session to help your pair improve.</li>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>I enjoyed pair programming with my partner. We were both very focused as we tried to create our HTML/CSS for this website. Often times, we ran into obstacles with getting the positioning and formatting correct on our website. This resulted in a lot of trial and error but we both learned alot from looking up other resources. As beneficial as I think pair programming is, I also think that it is a bit draining because it makes you aware of the communication you must have with your partner. In order for it to be engaging, you must always have some sort of open dialogue. Working remotely was at times difficult. I'm glad we are using Google Hangouts and Stypi to help us work collaboratively. Overall, I throughly enjoyed the paring session with my partner and would do so again.</p>
